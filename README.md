As I'm (ex-) recruiter this is an obvious choice for pet project^^. It's mostly playground for utils and architecture patterns - I'm trying to keep features limited for quick refactors.

My goal is to strongly couple client with server, but redirect implementation to a few abstract/ semi-automated modules - so I can have keep adding arbitrary data-models and APIs without having to maintain most of them (and the rest should be strongly typed with graphql-ts code generation for quick refactors).

To achieve it - I plan on reusing tons of auto-generated code and writing set of adapters on each step (form public API, through creating auto-updates to level of fabric components) - so most features can be generalised as some new module/middleware. I'm thinking I'm halfway there, the next step would be actually try to finish some parts of this app :)
